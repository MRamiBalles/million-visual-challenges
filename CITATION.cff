abstract: >-
  Million Visual Challenges is a research platform that integrates homological, 
  algebraic, and holographic obstructions to verify computational complexity 
  hypotheses. It features a Lean4 formalization of the homological separator 
  theory, empirically verified by a Python computational oracle.
